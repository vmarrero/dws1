				<p>Scrapbooking is a method for preserving personal and
				family history in the form of a scrapbook. Scrapbook
				albums are often decorated and frequently contain
				extensive journaling. Scrapbooking is a widely practiced
				pastime in the United States.</p>

				<p>Typical scrapbooking memorabilia includes
				photographs, printed media, and artwork.</p>

				<p>In addition to preserving memories, the hobby is
				popular for the strong social network that scrapbooking
				can provide.</p> <p>Hobbyists, known as
				<em>scrappers</em> or <em>scrapbookers</em>, get
				together and scrapbook at each other's homes, local
				scrapbook stores, scrapbooking conventions, retreat
				centers, and even on cruises. The attendees share tips
				and ideas as well as enjoying a social outlet.</p>

				<p class="note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> The term
				<em>crop</em>, a reference to cropping or trimming
				printed photographs, was coined to describe these
				events.</p>

				<h2>History</h2> 
				<h3>Commonplace Books</h3>

				<p>In the 15th century, commonplace books, popular in
				England, emerged as a way to compile information that
				included recipes, quotations, letters, poems and
				more.</p>

				<p>Each commonplace book was unique to its creator's
				particular interests.</p>

				<h3>Friendship Albums</h3>

				<p> Friendship albums became popular in the 16th
				century. These albums were used much like modern day
				yearbooks, where friends or patrons would enter their
				names, titles and short texts or illustrations at the
				request of the album's owner. These albums were often
				created as souvenirs of European tours and would contain
				local memorabilia including coats of arms or works of
				art commissioned by local artisans.[1]</p>

				<p>Starting in 1570, it became fashionable to
				incorporate colored plates depicting popular scenes such
				as Venetian costumes or Carnival scenes. These provided
				affordable options as compared to original works and, as
				such, these plates were not sold to commemorate or
				document a specific event, but specifically as
				embellishments for albums.</p>

				<p>In 1775, James Granger published a history of England
				with several blank pages at the end of the book. The
				pages were designed to allow the book's owner to
				personalize the book with his own memorabilia.</p>

				<p class="note"><strong>NOTE:</strong>
				Extra-illustrating or <em>grangerizing</em> is the
				practice of pasting engravings, lithographs and other
				illustrations into books, or even taking the books
				apart, inserting new matter, and rebinding them.</p>

				<p>Friendship albums and school yearbooks afforded girls
				in the 18th and 19th centuries an outlet through which
				to share their literary skills, and allowed girls an
				opportunity to document their own personalized
				historical record[3][4] previously not readily available
				to them.</p>

				<p>The advent of modern photography began with the first permanent
				photograph created by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in 1826.[5] This
				allowed the average person to begin to incorporate photographs into
				their scrapbooks.</p>

				<p>Old scrapbooks tended to have photos mounted with
				photomounting corners and perhaps notations of who was
				in a photo or where and when it was taken.</p>

				<p class="note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Bits of
				memorabilia like newspaper clippings and letters were
				often included in old scrapbooks.</p>

				<h2>Modern Scrapbooking</h2> 
				<h3>United States</h3> 
				<h4>Marielen Christensen</h4>

				<p>Marielen Christensen (pronounced as the names "Mary
				Ellen"), of Elk Ridge, Utah (formerly of Spanish Fork)
				is credited with turning scrapbooking from what was once
				just the age-old scrapbook hobby into the actual
				industry containing businesses devoted specifically to
				the sale and manufacturing of scrapbooking supplies.</p>

				<p>She began designing creative pages for her family's
				photo memories, inserting the completed pages into sheet
				protectors collected in 3-ring binders. By 1980, she had
				assembled <em>over fifty volumes</em> and was invited to
				display them at the World Conference on Records in Salt
				Lake City.</p>

				<p>Marielen and her husband A.J. authored and published a how-to
				book, <em>Keeping Memories Alive</em>, and opened a scrapbook store
				in Spanish Fork in 1981 that remains open today.</p>

				<h4>The Scrapbooking Industry</h4>

				<p>Following the lead of Keeping Memories Alive (in a
				smaller building next door and named The Annex in its
				early years), many other stores have popped up and cater
				to the scrapbooking community. These shops provide many
				of the necessary tools for every scrapbooker's needs.
				Besides Keeping Memories Alive, these include companies
				such as Creative Memories, Making Memories, Stamp It Up,
				and Close to My Heart.</p>

				<p>The scrapbooking industry doubled in size between
				2001 and 2004 to $2.5 billion[12] with over 1,600
				companies creating scrapbooking products by 2003.
				Creative Memories, a home-based retailer of scrapbooking
				supplies founded in 1987, saw $425 million in retail
				sales in 2004.[13] Creative Memories parent company did
				file Chapter 11 in 2013 and became the bankruptcy with
				the largest debt in the Twin City area.</p>

				<p>According to Google Trends, the search terms related
				to scrapbook and scrapbooking have seen a 70 percent
				<em>decline</em> since its peak in 2005-2006. [15]
				However, there is much debate among the community of
				people who engage in memory keeping about what the
				decline means for the health and future of the industry
				as a whole.</p>

				<h4>Scrapbooking Variations</h4>

				<p>It seems to be clear that traditional scrapbooking is
				once again in a transition period due to many forces,
				which include:</p> 
			
				<ol> 
					<li>Current economic issues</li> 
					<li>The influence of social media and the ease of digital sharing</li> 
					<li>The rejection of the stereotype of
					traditional scrapbooks being something that is for older
					women.</li> 
				</ol>

				<p>However, if one takes a closer look, it is easy to
				see all the ways people continue memory keeping even if
				it doesn't fall strictly within the definition of
				traditional scrapbooking as defined here.</p>

				<p>Some examples include the advent of "SMASH" books
				created by EK Success, which in some ways, are a closer
				representation to original scrapbooks in that they are
				wire bound books in a variety of sizes consisting of
				blank printed background papers into which one can
				journal and glue mementos into.</p>

				<p>Another current variation enjoying a surge in
				popularity is the introduction and growth of pocket
				scrapbooking, most well known and represented by
				"Project Life" created and introduced by Becky Higgins.
				Higgins created the system in response to her personal
				desire to continue record the lives of her children and
				family, but in a quicker, more simple way that allowed
				her the flexibility to complete the project, but still
				in an attractive, cohesive way.</p>

				<p>These days, scrapbooking can be done in so many ways.
				You can use beautiful colored paper, stickers, drawings,
				photos, and so many other supplies. Scrapbooking is like
				a visual diary, capturing all your creativity, thoughts
				feelings, and memories in a little book.</p>

				<h2>Scrapbooking Media</h2>
				<h3>Traditional Scrapbooking Materials</h3>
				<h4>Formats</h4>
		
				<p>The most important scrapbooking supply is the album
				itself, which can be permanently bound, or allow for the
				insertion of pages.</p>

				<p class="note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> There are other
				formats such as mini albums and accordion-style fold-out
				albums. Some of these are adhered to various containers,
				such as matchbooks, CD cases, or other small holders.

				<p>When scrap artists started moving away from the
				"page" and onto alternative surfaces and objectives,
				they termed these creations <em>altered items</em> or
				now simply called <em>off-the-page</em>. This movement
				circles back to the history of art from the 1960s when
				Louise Nevelson was doing <em>assemblages</em> with
				found objects and recycled parts.</p>

				<p>Modern scrapbooking is done largely on 12 inch (30
				<abbr title ="centimeter">cm</abbr>) square or
				letter-size (US Letter (8.5 by 11 inch) or A4 (210 by
				297 <abbr title ="millimeter">mm</abbr>)) pages.</p>

				<p>More recently, smaller albums have become popular.
				The most common new formats are 6, 7, or 8-inch (15,
				17.5, or 20 <abbr title ="centimeter">cm</abbr>) square.
				It is important to many scrappers to protect their pages
				with clear page protectors.</p>

				<h4>Basic Materials</h4>

				<p>Basic materials include background papers (including printed
				and cardstock paper), photo corner mounts (or other means of
				mounting photos such as adhesive dots, photo mounting tape, or
				acid-free glue), scissors, a paper trimmer or cutting tool, art
				pens, archival pens for journaling, and mounting glues (like
				thermo-tac).</p>

				<p>More elaborate designs require more specialized tools
				such as die cut templates, rubber stamps, craft punches,
				stencils, inking tools, eyelet setters, heat embossing
				tools and personal die cut machines.</p>

				<p>A lot of time people who enjoy scrapbooking will
				create their own background papers by using the tools
				mentioned along with "fancy" textured succors.</p>

				<h4>Accessories</h4>

				<p>Various accessories, referred to as "embellishments",
				are used to decorate scrapbook pages.</p>

				<p>Embellishments include stickers, rub-ons, stamps,
				eyelets, brads, chipboard elements in various shapes,
				alphabet letters, lace, wire, fabric, beads, sequins,
				and ribbon.

				<p>The use of die cut machines is also increasingly
				popular; in recent years a number of electronic
				die-cutting machines resembling a plotter with a drag
				knife have hit the market (e.g. The Cricut), enabling
				scrappers to use their computer to create die cuts out
				of any shape or font with the use of free or third party
				software.</p>

				<p>Scrapbook makers will also use magazine clippings to
				"decorate" their scrapbook pages.</p>

				<h4>Archival Supplies</h4>

				<p>One of the key components of modern scrapbooking is
				the archival quality of the supplies.</p>

				<p>Designed to preserve photographs and journaling in
				their original state, materials encouraged by most
				serious scrapbookers are of a higher quality than those
				of many typical photo albums commercially available.</p>
		
				<p>Scrappers insist on acid-free, lignin-free papers, stamp ink,
				and embossing powder.</p>

				<p>They also use pigment-based inks, which are fade
				resistant, colorfast, and often waterproof.</p>

				<p>Many scrappers use buffered paper, which will protect
				photos from acid in memorabilia used in the scrapbook.
				Older "magnetic" albums are not acid-free and thus cause
				damage to the photos and memorabilia included in them.

				<p>Gloves, too, are used to protect photos from the oil
				on hands.</p>

				<p>An international standard, ISO 18902, provides
				specific guidelines on materials that are safe for
				scrapbooking through its requirements for albums,
				framing, and storage materials. ISO 18902 includes
				requirements for photo-safety and a specific pH range
				for acid-free materials. ISO 18902 prohibits the use of
				harmful materials, including Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
				and Cellulose nitrate.</p>

				<h3>Digital Scrapbooking</h3>

				<p>The advent of scanners, desktop publishing, page
				layout programs, and advanced printing options make it
				relatively easy to create professional-looking layouts
				in digital form.</p>

				<p>The internet allows scrapbookers to self-publish
				their work. Scrapbooks that exist completely in digital
				image form are referred to as <em>digital
				scrapbooks</em> or <em>computer scrapbooks</em>.</p>

				<p>While some people prefer the physicality of the
				actual artifacts they paste onto the pages of books, the
				digital scrapbooking hobby has grown in popularity in
				recent years.[20]</p>

				<p>Some of the advantages of digital scrapbooking
				include:</p>
		
				<ol>
					<li>A greater diversity of materials</li>
					<li>Less environmental impact</li>
					<li>Cost savings</li>
					<li>The ability to share finished pages more readily on the 
					internet</li>
					<li>The use of image editing software to experiment with
					manipulating page elements in multiple ways without making
					permanent adjustments</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p>A traditional scrapbook layout may employ a background paper
				with a torn edge. While a physical page can only be torn once
				and never restored, a digital paper can be torn and untorn with
				ease, allowing the scrapbooker to try out different looks
				without wasting supplies.</p>

				<p class="note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Some web-based
				digital scrapbooks include a variety of wallpapers and
				backgrounds to help the users create a rich visual
				experience. Each paper, photo, or embellishment exists
				on its own layer in your document, and you can
				reposition them at your discretion.</p>

				<p>Digital scrapbooking is <em>not</em> limited to
				digital storage and display. Many digital scrappers
				print their finished layouts to be stored in scrapbook
				albums. Others have books professionally printed in hard
				bound books to be saved as keepsakes. Professional
				printing- and binding-services offer free software to
				create scrapbooks with professional layouts and
				individual layout capabilities. Because of the
				integrated design and order workflow, real hardcover
				bound books can be produced more cost effectively.</p>

				<p>Early digital scrapbooks were created from digital
				photos uploaded to an external site. Over time, this
				moved to a model of downloading software onto a personal
				computer that will organize photos and help create the
				digital scrapbook. With the growth of Web 2.0
				functionality, digital scrapbooking is going back
				online, to avoid the hassles of having to download and
				install <abbr title ="Personal Computer">PC</abbr>
				software. The availability of cheap online storage
				(e.g., on Amazon's S3 service), and the desire to
				leverage pre-uploaded online albums (e.g., on Yahoo's
				Flickr) make it more convenient for users to directly
				compose their digital scrapbooks online. Print on demand
				fulfillment enables such digital scrapbooks to
				effectively supplant traditional scrapbooks.</p>
		
				<p>Digital scrapbooking has advanced to the point where digital
				scrapbook layouts may be made entirely online using Web-based
				software. Users upload their photos, create a digital scrapbook
				layout using a Web page and digital scrapbook graphics. The
				layout can then be downloaded as a low-resolution <abbr title
				="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> file for sharing
				on the Web or as a high-resolution <abbr title ="Joint
				Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> file for printing.</p>

				<h2>Scrapbooking Industry Statistics</h2>

				<p>Some people attribute the increased interest in
				scrapbooking to a renewed passion for genealogy, while
				others say that it is an outlet for those interested in
				photography and graphic design.</p>

				<p>For evidence of interest in scrapbooking, consider
				the following facts:</p>
		
				<ol>
					<li>Over 4 million women in the United States alone consider
					themselves to be scrapbookers.</li>
					<li>Over 4% of all women in U.S. have done traditional
					scrapbooking. Millions of others do various aspects of photo
					books but are not scrapbookers.</li>
					<li>Scrapbooking is one of the largest categories within the
					craft and hobby industry and now considered[by whom?] to be the
					third most popular craft in the nation.</li>
				</ol>
		
				<p>From 1996 through 2004, sales of scrapbooking products
				increased across the United States. In 2005, annual sales
				flattened for the first time after many back to back years of
				double growth. From 2006 through 2010 traditional scrapbooking
				sales have declined, while digital forms of scrapbooking have
				grown. Traditional scrapbooking sales for 2010 have declined to
				about $1.6 billion in annual sales from a peak of about $2.5
				billion in 2005.</p>

				<p>During that same time frame the number of independent
				scrapbooking stores declined from a high of 4,200 to
				about 1,200 independent storefronts. The number of
				scrapbooking manufacturers also declined in that same
				period from a high of 800 to under 250.</p>

			<div id ="idioms">
				<h2>Common Scrapbooking Idioms</h2> <h3>Journaling</h3>

				<p>In addition to the collection of photographs,
				tickets, postcards, and other memorabilia, journaling is
				often a principal element in modern scrapbooks.</p>

				<p class="note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Journaling is
				text that describes, explains, or accents the
				photographs on a scrapbook page.</p>

				<p>Contemporary journaling can take many forms. It can
				be reflective and story-like, take a reportive tone, or
				simply be a list of words. Journaling may also include
				song lyrics, quotations, and poems. The value of
				journaling lies in the fact that it provides an account
				of family histories that may otherwise not be
				preserved.</p>

				<p>Many consider journaling one of the most important
				elements of any scrapbook.[24] Journaling is a personal
				choice and it can describe the event, the photographs,
				or relate feelings and emotions.</p>

				<p>Handwritten journaling is considered best by some
				scrapbookers who see handwriting as valuable for
				posterity, but many people journal on the computer and
				print it onto a variety of surfaces including vellum,
				tape, ribbon, and paper.</p>

				<h3>Sketches</h3>

				<p>Scrapbookers will sometimes refer to sketches for
				inspiration for their pages.[citation needed]</p>

				<p class="note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Sketches are a
				hand-drawn layout showing where to position photos,
				titles, journaling and embellishments.</p>
		
				<p>Sketches give novice scrapbookers somewhere to begin
				if they are not experienced with balancing the layout
				correctly.</p>

				<p>Scrapbookers can interpret the sketch in any way they
				choose; it is a great starting point when you have
				scrappers-block. There have been many sketchbooks
				published and scrapbooking magazines always offer
				sketches as part of their content.[original
