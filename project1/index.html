		<p>Drawing is a form of visual art that makes use of any number
		of drawing instruments to mark a two-dimensional medium.
		Instruments used include graphite pencils, pen and ink, inked
		brushes, wax color pencils, crayons, charcoal, chalk, pastels,
		various kinds of erasers, markers, styluses, various metals
		(such as silverpoint) and electronic drawing. An artist who
		practices or works in technical drawing may be called a drafter
		or draftsman or draughtsman.</p>

		<p>A small amount of material is released onto a surface,
		leaving a visible mark. The most common support for drawing is
		paper, although other materials, such as cardboard, plastic,
		leather, canvas, and board, may be used. Temporary drawings may
		be made on a blackboard or whiteboard or indeed almost anything.
		The medium has been a popular and fundamental means of public
		expression throughout human history. It is one of the simplest
		and most efficient means of communicating visual ideas.[2] The
		wide availability of drawing instruments makes drawing one of
		the most common artistic activities.</p>
		
		<h2 id ="overview">Overview</h2>
		
		<p>Drawing is one of the major forms of expression within the
		visual arts. It is generally concerned with the marking of lines
		and areas of tone onto paper, where the accurate representation
		of the visual world is expressed upon a plane surface.[3]
		Traditional drawings were monochrome, or at least had little
		colour,[4] while modern colored-pencil drawings may approach or
		cross a boundary between drawing and painting. In Western
		terminology, drawing is distinct from painting, even though
		similar media often are employed in both tasks. Dry media,
		normally associated with drawing, such as chalk, may be used in
		pastel paintings. Drawing may be done with a liquid medium,
		applied with brushes or pens. Similar supports likewise can
		serve both: painting generally involves the application of
		liquid paint onto prepared canvas or panels, but sometimes an
		underdrawing is drawn first on that same support.</p>

		<p>Drawing is often exploratory, with considerable emphasis on
		observation, problem-solving and composition. Drawing is also
		regularly used in preparation for a painting, further
		obfuscating their distinction. Drawings created for these
		purposes are called studies.</p>

		<p>There are several categories of drawing, including figure
		drawing, cartooning, doodling and shading. There are also many
		drawing methods, such as line drawing, stippling, shading, the
		surrealist method of entopic graphomania (in which dots are made
		at the sites of impurities in a blank sheet of paper, and lines
		are then made between the dots), and tracing (drawing on a
		translucent paper, such as tracing paper, around the outline of
		preexisting shapes that show through the paper).</p>
		
		<p>A quick, unrefined drawing may be called a sketch.</p>
		
		<p>In fields outside art, technical drawings or plans of
		buildings, machinery, circuitry and other things are often
		called "drawings" even when they have been transferred to
		another medium by printing.</p>
		
		<h2 id ="history">History</h2>
		
		<p><strong>Drawing as a Form of Communication</strong> Drawing
		is one of the oldest forms of human expression, with evidence
		for its existence preceding that of written communication.[5] It
		is believed that drawing was used as a specialised form of
		communication before the invent of the written language,[5][6]
		demonstrated by the production of cave and rock paintings
		created by Homo sapien sapiens around 30,000 years ago.[7] These
		drawings, known as pictograms, depicted objects and abstract
		concepts.[8] The sketches and paintings produced in prehistoric
		times were eventually stylised and simplified, leading to the
		development of the written language as we know it today.</p>

		<p><strong>Drawing in the Arts</strong> Drawing is used to
		express one's creativity, and therefore has been prominent in
		the world of art. Throughout much of history, drawing was
		regarded as the foundation for artistic practise.[9] Initially,
		artists used and re-used wooden tablets for the production of
		their drawings.[10] Following the widespread availability of
		paper in the 14th century, the use drawing in the arts
		increased. At this point, drawing was commonly used as a tool
		for thought and investigation, acting as a study medium whilst
		artists were preparing for their final pieces of work.[11][12]
		In a period of artistic flourish, the Renaissance brought about
		drawings exhibiting realistic representational qualities,[13]
		where there was a lot of influence from geometry and
		philosophy.</p>

		<p>The invention of the first widely available form of
		photography led to a shift in the use of drawing in the
		arts.[15] Photography took over from drawing as a more superior
		method for accurately representing the visual world. Following
		the invention of photography, artists began to abandon
		traditional drawing practises.[16] Modernism in the arts
		encouraged 'imaginative originality'[17] and artists became more
		abstract in their approach to drawing.</p>

		<p><strong>Drawing Outside of the Arts</strong> Although the use
		of drawing is extensive in the arts, its practice is not
		confined purely to this field. Before the widespread
		availability of paper, 12th century monks in European
		monasteries used intricate drawings to prepare illustrated,
		illuminated manuscripts on vellum and parchment. Drawing has
		also been used extensively in the field of science, as a method
		of discovery, understanding and explanation. In 1616, astronomer
		Galileo Galilei explained the changing phases of the moon
		through his observational telescopic drawings.[16] Additionally,
		in 1924, geophysicist Alfred Wegener used illustrations to
		visually demonstrate the origin of the continents.[16]</p>

		<h2 id ="materials">Materials</h2>
		
		<p>The medium is the means by which ink, pigment or color are
		delivered onto the drawing surface. Most drawing media are
		either dry (e.g. graphite, charcoal, pastels, Conté,
		silverpoint), or use a fluid solvent or carrier (marker, pen and
		ink). Watercolor pencils can be used dry like ordinary pencils,
		then moistened with a wet brush to get various painterly
		effects. Very rarely, artists have drawn with (usually decoded)
		invisible ink. Metalpoint drawing usually employs either of two
		metals: silver or lead.[18] More rarely used are gold, platinum,
		copper, brass, bronze, and tinpoint.</p>

		<p>Paper comes in a variety of different sizes and qualities,
		ranging from newspaper grade up to high quality and relatively
		expensive paper sold as individual sheets.[19] Papers can vary
		in texture, hue, acidity, and strength when wet. Smooth paper is
		good for rendering fine detail, but a more "toothy" paper will
		hold the drawing material better. Thus a coarser material is
		useful for producing deeper contrast.</p>

		<p>Newsprint and typing paper may be useful for practice and
		rough sketches. Tracing paper is used to experiment over a
		half-finished drawing, and to transfer a design from one sheet
		to another. Cartridge paper is the basic type of drawing paper
		sold in pads. Bristol board and even heavier acid-free boards,
		frequently with smooth finishes, are used for drawing fine
		detail and do not distort when wet media (ink, washes) are
		applied. Vellum is extremely smooth and suitable for very fine
		detail. Coldpressed watercolor paper may be favored for ink
		drawing due to its texture.</p>

		<p>Acid-free, archival quality paper keeps its color and texture
		far longer than wood pulp based paper such as newsprint, which
		will turn yellow and become brittle much sooner.

		<p>The basic tools are a drawing board or table, pencil
		sharpener and eraser, and for ink drawing, blotting paper. Other
		tools used are circle compass, ruler, and set square. Fixative
		is used to prevent pencil and crayon marks from smudging.
		Drafting tape is used to secure paper to drawing surface, and
		also to mask an area to keep it free of accidental marks sprayed
		or spattered materials and washes. An easel or slanted table is
		used to keep the drawing surface in a suitable position, which
		is generally more horizontal than the position used in
		painting.</p>
		
		<h2 id ="technique">Technique</h2>
		
		<p>Almost all draftsmen use their hands and fingers to apply the
		media, with the exception of some handicapped individuals who
		draw with their mouth or feet.[20]</p>

		<p>Prior to working on an image, the artist will likely want to
		gain an understanding of how the various media will work. The
		different drawing implements can be tried on practice sheets in
		order to determine value and texture, and how to apply the
		implement in order to produce various effects.</p>

		<p>The drawing strokes used control the appearance of the image.
		Pen and ink drawings often use hatching, which consists of
		groups of parallel lines.[21] Cross-hatching uses hatching in
		two or more different directions to create a darker tone. Broken
		hatching, or lines with intermittent breaks, can be used to form
		lighter tones, and by controlling the density of the breaks a
		gradation of tone can be achieved. Stippling, uses dots to
		produce tone, texture or shade. Different textures can be
		achieved depending on the method used to build tone.[22]</p>

		<p>Drawings in dry media often use similar techniques, although
		with pencils and drawing sticks continuous variations in tone
		can be achieved. Typically a drawing will be filled in based on
		which hand the artist favors. A right-handed artist will want to
		draw from left to right in order to avoid smearing the image.
		Erasers can be used with many media to remove unwanted lines,
		lighten tones and clean up stray marks.</p>

		<p>In a sketch or outline drawing, the lines drawn often follow
		the contour of the subject being drawn, creating depth by
		looking like shadows cast from a light in the artist's
		position.</p>

		<p>Sometimes the artist will want to leave a section of the
		image untouched while filling in the remainder of the picture.
		The shape of the area to be preserved can be painted on with
		masking fluid or cut out of a frisket and applied to the drawing
		surface, protecting the surface from stray marks until the mask
		is removed.</p>

		<p>Another method to preserve a section of the image is to apply
		a spray-on fixative to the surface. This will hold loose
		material more firmly to the sheet and prevent it from smearing.
		However the fixative spray typically uses chemicals that can
		harm the respiratory system, so it should be employed in a
		well-ventilated area such as outdoors.</p>

		<p>Another technique is subtractive drawing in which the drawing
		surface is covered with graphite or charcoal and then erased to
		make the image.[23]</p>

		<h2 id ="tone">Tone</h2>
		
		<p>Shading is the technique of varying the tonal values on the
		paper to represent the shade of the material as well as the
		placement of the shadows. Careful attention to reflected light,
		shadows and highlights can result in a very realistic rendition
		of the image.</p>

		<p>Blending uses an implement to soften or spread the original
		drawing strokes. Blending is most easily done with a medium that
		does not immediately fix itself, such as graphite, chalk, or
		charcoal, although freshly applied ink can be smudged, wet or
		dry, for some effects. For shading and blending, the artist can
		use a blending stump, tissue, a kneaded eraser, a fingertip, or
		any combination of them. A piece of chamois is useful for
		creating smooth textures, and for removing material to lighten
		the tone. Continuous tone can be achieved with graphite on a
		smooth surface without blending, but the technique is laborious,
		involving small circular or oval strokes with a somewhat blunt
		point.</p>

		<p>Shading techniques that also introduce texture to the drawing
		include hatching and stippling. There are a number of other
		methods for producing texture in the picture: in addition to
		choosing a suitable paper, the type of drawing material and the
		drawing technique will result in different textures. Texture can
		be made to appear more realistic when it is drawn next to a
		contrasting texture; a coarse texture will be more obvious when
		placed next to a smoothly blended area. A similar effect can be
		achieved by drawing different tones close together; a light edge
		next to a dark background will stand out to the eye, and almost
		appear to float above the surface.</p>
		
		<h2 id ="formandprop">Form and Proportion</h2>

		<p>Measuring the dimensions of a subject while blocking in the
		drawing is an important step in producing a realistic rendition
		of the subject. Tools such as a compass can be used to measure
		the angles of different sides. These angles can be reproduced on
		the drawing surface and then rechecked to make sure they are
		accurate. Another form of measurement is to compare the relative
		sizes of different parts of the subject with each other. A
		finger placed at a point along the drawing implement can be used
		to compare that dimension with other parts of the image. A ruler
		can be used both as a straightedge and a device to compute
		proportions.</p>

		<p>When attempting to draw a complicated shape such as a human
		figure, it is helpful at first to represent the form with a set
		of primitive shapes. Almost any form can be represented by some
		combination of the cube, sphere, cylinder, and cone. Once these
		basic shapes have been assembled into a likeness, then the
		drawing can be refined into a more accurate and polished form.
		The lines of the primitive shapes are removed and replaced by
		the final likeness. Drawing the underlying construction is a
		fundamental skill for representational art and is taught in many
		books and schools, as its correct application will resolve most
		uncertainties about smaller details and make the final image
		look self-consistent.[25]</p>

		<p>A more refined art of figure drawing relies upon the artist
		possessing a deep understanding of anatomy and the human
		proportions. A trained artist is familiar with the skeleton
		structure, joint location, muscle placement, tendon movement,
		and how the different parts work together during movement. This
		allows the artist to render more natural poses that do not
		appear artificially stiff. The artist is also familiar with how
		the proportions vary depending on the age of the subject,
		particularly when drawing a portrait.</p>
		
		<h2 id ="perspective">Perspective</h2>
		
		<p>Linear perspective is a method of portraying objects on a
		flat surface so that the dimensions shrink with distance. Each
		set of parallel, straight edges of any object, whether a
		building or a table, will follow lines that eventually converge
		at a vanishing point. Typically this point of convergence will
		be along the horizon, as buildings are built level with the flat
		surface. When multiple structures are aligned with each other,
		such as buildings along a street, the horizontal tops and
		bottoms of the structures will all typically converge at a
		vanishing point.</p>

		<p>When both the fronts and sides of a building are drawn, then
		the parallel lines forming a side converge at a second point
		along the horizon (which may be off the drawing paper.) This is
		a two-point perspective.[26] Converging the vertical lines to a
		third point above or below the horizon then produces a
		three-point perspective.</p>

		<p>Depth can also be portrayed by several techniques in addition
		to the perspective approach above. Objects of similar size
		should appear ever smaller the further they are from the viewer.
		Thus the back wheel of a cart will appear slightly smaller than
		the front wheel. Depth can be portrayed through the use of
		texture. As the texture of an object gets further away it
		becomes more compressed and busy, taking on an entirely
		different character than if it was close. Depth can also be
		portrayed by reducing the contrast in more distant objects, and
		by making their colors less saturated. This will reproduce the
		effect of atmospheric haze, and cause the eye to focus primarily
		on objects drawn in the foreground.</p>
		
		<h2 id ="artistry">Artistry</h2>
		
		<p>The composition of the image is an important element in
		producing an interesting work of artistic merit. The artist
		plans the placement of elements in the art in order to
		communicate ideas and feelings with the viewer. The composition
		can determine the focus of the art, and result in a harmonious
		whole that is aesthetically appealing and stimulating.

		<p>The illumination of the subject is also a key element in
		creating an artistic piece, and the interplay of light and
		shadow is a valuable method in the artist's toolbox. The
		placement of the light sources can make a considerable
		difference in the type of message that is being presented.
		Multiple light sources can wash out any wrinkles in a person's
		face, for instance, and give a more youthful appearance. In
		contrast, a single light source, such as harsh daylight, can
		serve to highlight any texture or interesting features.

		<p>When drawing an object or figure, the skilled artist pays
		attention to both the area within the silhouette and what lies
		outside. The exterior is termed the negative space, and can be
		as important in the representation as the figure. Objects placed
		in the background of the figure should appear properly placed
		wherever they can be viewed.

		<p>A study is a draft drawing that is made in preparation for a
		planned final image. Studies can be used to determine the
		appearances of specific parts of the completed image, or for
		experimenting with the best approach for accomplishing the end
		goal. However a well-crafted study can be a piece of art in its
		own right, and many hours of careful work can go into completing
		a study.
		
		<h2 id ="drawingprocess">The Drawing Process</h2>
		
		<p>Individuals display differences in their ability to produce
		visually accurate drawings.[27] A visually accurate drawing is
		described as being "recognized as a particular object at a
		particular time and in a particular space, rendered with little
		addition of visual detail that can not be seen in the object
		represented or with little deletion of visual detail”.[28]

		<p>Investigative studies have aimed to explain the reasons why
		some individuals are better at drawing than others. A study
		explained that the perception of objects being drawn, the
		ability to make good representational decisions, the motor
		skills required for mark making and the perception of one’s
		drawing were the four stages involved in the process of
		drawing.[28] Following this explanation, several studies have
		been conducted to conclude which of these processes are the most
		significant in affecting the accuracy of drawings.

		<p><strong>Motor Function</strong> Motor function has been
		recognised as an important physical component in the 'Production
		Phase' of the drawing process.[29] It has been suggested that
		motor function plays a role in drawing ability, although its
		effects are not significant.[28]

		<p><strong>Perception</strong> It has been suggested that an
		individual's ability to perceive an object they are drawing is
		the most important stage in the drawing process.[28] This
		suggestion is supported by the discovery of a robust
		relationship between perception and drawing ability.[30]

		<p>This evidence acted at the basis of Betty Edwards' how-to
		drawing book, Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain.[31]
		Edwards aimed to teach her readers how to draw, based on the
		development of the reader's perceptual abilities.

		<p>Furthermore, the influential artist and art critic John
		Ruskin emphasised the importance perception in the drawing
		process in his book The Elements of Drawing.[32] He stated that
		"For I am nearly convinced, that once we see keenly enough,
		there is very little difficult in drawing what we see".

		<p><strong>Visual Memory</strong> Visual memory has also been
		shown to influence one's ability to create visually accurate
		drawings. Short-term memory plays an important part in drawing
		as one’s gaze shifts between the object they are drawing and the
		drawing itself.[33]
